# 🧮 Calculator in C
A simple calculator program written in C

### Features
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

#### (Division Operation Note): <br>
-In mathematics, a number cannot be divided by zero, as the result of such an operation is undefined. The code is written with this rule in mind.<br>
-If the user attempts to divide by zero, the program displays the message: <br>
“Division by zero is not possible. Incorrect! Please enter a new second number:” <br>
and requests a valid input to safely continue the calculation.<br>
-After completing an operations, the user can choose to continue or terminate the program by responding with yes or no.

 ### What I Learned
- User input with scanf
- Controlling program flow with conditional statements
- Error handling <br>

In this project, I learned how to take user input using scanf, make decisions in the program using conditional statements, and handle basic errors such as division by zero to ensure the program runs safely and correctly.
